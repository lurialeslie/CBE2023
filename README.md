Training: Enable, Empower, Succeed: A Bioinformatics Workshop Harnessing Open Web-Based Tools for Surveillance of Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance in Cameroon
 
**Summary
**Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern. With the advent of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the collection of sufficiently large datasets of various isolates, bioinformatics is plausible to gain new insights into the more complex molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. This training will equip next-generation researchers with bioinformatics skills to support genomics surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Cameroon. It will introduce participants to data file formats used in bacterial sequencing, web-based browsers to analyse genomic data, how to predict the resistance phenotype of bacteria, and how to share data so that others worldwide can benefit. These skills are the building blocks for scaling up genomics to antibiotic resistance surveillance in Cameroon. 
**Goal**
To build capacity for analysis of genomics data to support antibiotic resistance surveillance in Cameroon
